# Implementation Plan: Telegram Channel URL Monitor with yt-dlp Integration

**Branch**: `feature/001-build-an-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-app/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ‚Üí If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ‚Üí Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   ‚Üí Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ‚Üí If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   ‚Üí If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   ‚Üí Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 ‚Üí research.md
   ‚Üí If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 ‚Üí contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   ‚Üí If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   ‚Üí Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 ‚Üí Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Automated Telegram bot that monitors a private channel for URLs, downloads them via yt-dlp (local or remote), and provides real-time emoji feedback (üëÄ Seen ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Processing ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete). Bot uses Telegram Bot API Token authentication, sequential download processing, SQLite persistence for queue recovery, and configurable storage destinations. Configuration via config file with environment variable overrides (12-factor pattern). Deployed as Docker container to Unraid platform with health checks and volume mounts for data/downloads.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# 12 / .NET 8 LTS  
**Primary Dependencies**: Telegram.Bot (Bot API client), Microsoft.Data.Sqlite (persistence), Serilog (structured logging)  
**Storage**: SQLite for queue/state persistence, filesystem for downloaded media  
**Testing**: xUnit, Moq (mocking), FluentAssertions, Testcontainers (integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: Docker container on Linux (Unraid), developed in VS Code devcontainer  
**Project Type**: Single (backend service with no frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: <5s message detection latency, <1s emoji reaction response, handle 100+ queued downloads  
**Constraints**: Sequential downloads only, <200MB memory footprint, graceful restart with queue recovery  
**Scale/Scope**: Single channel monitoring, ~10-50 URLs/day typical, designed for 24/7 operation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Test-Driven Development**: ‚úÖ Unit tests for URL extraction, queue management, state persistence. Integration tests for Telegram API mocking. E2E tests with test channel + mock yt-dlp. TDD enforced via pre-PR quality gates.
- **Code Quality Standards**: ‚úÖ C# nullable reference types enabled, XML docs for public APIs, PSScriptAnalyzer for scripts. EditorConfig for consistent formatting. SonarAnalyzer for code quality metrics.
- **Security First**: ‚úÖ Bot token via environment variable/Docker secrets only. yt-dlp API credentials (if remote mode) stored securely. Input validation on all URLs and message text. No secrets in repository.
- **Performance Requirements**: ‚úÖ <5s message polling latency (Telegram Bot API long polling). <1s emoji reaction updates. Sequential queue prevents resource contention. SQLite indexed queries for O(log n) lookups.
- **User Experience Consistency**: ‚úÖ Predictable emoji progression (üëÄ‚Üí‚öôÔ∏è‚Üí‚úÖ/‚ùå). Clear startup logs with config validation. Comprehensive error messages in logs. Graceful degradation on network failures.
- **Deployment Standards**: ‚úÖ Multi-stage Dockerfile (build + runtime). Health check endpoint (/health HTTP). Docker volumes for SQLite DB and downloads. Unraid Community Applications template. Non-root container user.
- **Pre-PR Quality Gates**: ‚úÖ dotnet format for auto-fix. PSScriptAnalyzer --Fix for PowerShell. All unit/integration tests must pass. Coverage gate ‚â•80% for core logic.

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen (not web/mobile). Backend service only with no user-facing frontend. Clear separation: Models (data), Services (logic), Persistence (storage), Configuration (settings). Tests mirror source structure with unit/integration/E2E distinction.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**Output**: `research.md` with all technical decisions resolved.

**Decisions Made**:
1. Telegram.Bot library (official .NET client) for Bot API integration
2. Strategy pattern for local/remote yt-dlp execution modes
3. SQLite schema with 3 tables (ProcessedMessages, DownloadJobs, AppState)
4. 12-factor configuration: appsettings.json + environment variable overrides
5. ASP.NET Core minimal API for /health endpoint
6. Hardcoded emoji defaults with config file overrides
7. Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
8. Structured JSON logging via Serilog to stdout
9. Post-download actions deferred to future (MVP logs only)
10. yt-dlp config file pass-through via --config-location argument
11. Optional remote API key via Authorization header
12. Metrics exposure deferred to future (health check sufficient for MVP)

**Design Highlights**:
- Clean separation of concerns (Models, Services, Persistence, Configuration)
- Interface-driven design for testability and DI
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent reads during writes
- Event-driven architecture (MessageReceived event pattern)
- Strategy pattern for yt-dlp mode switching
- Retry logic with Polly resilience library

---

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
1. Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
2. Generate tasks from Phase 1 design artifacts:
   - **Contract Tests** (T001-T005): One test class per interface contract
   - **Model Creation** (T006-T008): Entity classes + SQLite schema setup
   - **Service Implementation** (T009-T018): Implement each interface with TDD
   - **Configuration** (T019-T020): Config loading + validation
   - **Integration** (T021-T023): Wire up DI, health checks, main program
   - **Pre-PR Quality Gates** (T024-T029): Linting, testing, Docker build
   - **Documentation** (T030-T032): README, deployment guides

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD Order**: Tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Dependency Order**: 
  1. Models (no dependencies)
  2. State/persistence layer
  3. Business services (depend on models/persistence)
  4. Integration/orchestration (depends on all services)
- **Parallelization**: Mark [P] for tasks operating on different files

**Estimated Output**: ~30 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`

**Task Template Structure** (per constitution):
```
- [ ] T###: [Description]
  - Type: [Contract Test | Unit Test | Implementation | Integration | Infrastructure]
  - Files: [paths to create/modify]
  - Dependencies: [prerequisite task numbers]
  - Acceptance: [how to verify completion]
  - [P] (if parallel-safe)
```

**Example Tasks** (will be fully generated by /tasks):
- T001: Write ITelegramMonitor contract tests [P]
- T006: Create DownloadJob model class [P]
- T009: Implement UrlExtractor service (TDD)
- T021: Wire up dependency injection in Program.cs
- T024: Run dotnet format and verify linting passes

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the `/tasks` command, NOT by `/plan`

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** ‚Üí `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action ‚Üí endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story ‚Üí integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract ‚Üí contract test task [P]
- Each entity ‚Üí model creation task [P] 
- Each user story ‚Üí integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No Complexity Deviations** ‚úÖ

All constitutional requirements met:
- TDD enforced (tests before implementation in task order)
- Code quality standards applied (dotnet format, PSScriptAnalyzer)
- Security first (secrets via env vars, input validation)
- Performance requirements achievable (<5s latency, sequential processing)
- UX consistency (emoji progression, clear logging)
- Deployment standards (Docker, health checks, volumes)
- Pre-PR quality gates (linting, testing in Phase 3.6 tasks)
